# Method Used

### 1.Processed the data according to the requirment in order to perform operations on it.
### 2.Used kmeans cluster algorithm to find suitable clusters.
### 3.Used elbow method to find the optimum number of clusters.
### 4.Used folium to draw the map for visual representation
### 5.Used CNN for extracting features from dataset
### 6.Used Naive Bias for sentiment analysis.


# Inference
### 1.Predicted sentences from the model is not accurate due to which sentiment analysis is wrong.

### 2.Sentence extraction from the image is not correct.
### 3.Optimum number of cluters in the task 1.
### 4.In UP the clusters almost covers the entire area in the map
